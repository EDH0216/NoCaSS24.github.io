                <b>Gabriel Ferreras Garrucho</b>
              </h4>
              <p>Gabriel is a second year PhD student working with Prof. Uta Paszkowski at the Crop Science Centre, University of Cambridge. His work focuses on pre-symbiotic signalling in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice, with a particular interest in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the interaction. He uses transcriptomics, spatially restricted mutant complementation, single-cell sequencing datasets and fluorescent biosensors to elucidate where, when, and how the plant deploys its symbiotic arsenal to establish a beneficial interaction versus starting a defence response against a pathogen.</p>
              <p>Gabriel is the treasurer of the NoCaSS 2023 team, organising the fundraising efforts, contacting sponsors, planning the budget, and generally making sure there are no financial issues to spoil all the fun during the conference.</p>

              </h4>
              <p>Emily is a first year PhD student in Sarah Robinson's group at the Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge. Her research focuses on the relationship between cell division and mechanical properties in the context of Arabidopsis thaliana growth. She uses a variety of imaging and biomechanical analysis methods, including confocal microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and extensometer techniques.</p>
              <p>Emily is the accommodation lead of the NoCaSS 2023 team, coordinating and securing housing for all of the visiting attendees.</p>

              </h4>
              <p>Lucía is a fourth year PhD student working with Dr. Johannes Kromdijk at the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge. She uses physiological and molecular approaches to do a comparative analysis of C3 and C4 photosynthesis under dynamic light conditions, as well as the photoprotective responses of each pathway.</p>
              <p>Lucía is part of the soft skills team and has led efforts to organise and secure speakers for our Careers panel. The organising committee is highly cooperative, and Lucía has also been involved in graphic design, social media, and catering.</p>

                <b>Humberto Herrera-Ubaldo</b>
              </h4>
              <p>Humberto is a postdoc working with Dr. Beverley J. Glover at the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge. He is interested in understanding the formation of iridescent colours produced by the periodic ordering of nanoscale structures in the petals. He completed a Ph.D. in Plant Biotechnology (Cinvestav, México), studying carpel and fruit development in Arabidopsis.</p>
              <p>Humberto, with Lucía and Marina, form the Soft-skills Team of the NoCaSS23 conference, one of the most recent additions to the event. He has been especially involved in organising a discussion session about scientific writing and publishing.</p>
