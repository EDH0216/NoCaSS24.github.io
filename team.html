                <b>Gabriel Ferreras Garrucho</b>
              </h4>
              <p>Gabriel is a second year PhD student working with Prof. Uta Paszkowski at the Crop Science Centre, University of Cambridge. His work focuses on pre-symbiotic signalling in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice, with a particular interest in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the interaction. He uses transcriptomics, spatially restricted mutant complementation, single-cell sequencing datasets and fluorescent biosensors to elucidate where, when, and how the plant deploys its symbiotic arsenal to establish a beneficial interaction versus starting a defence response against a pathogen.</p>
              <p>Gabriel is the treasurer of the NoCaSS 2023 team, organising the fundraising efforts, contacting sponsors, planning the budget, and generally making sure there are no financial issues to spoil all the fun during the conference.</p>
