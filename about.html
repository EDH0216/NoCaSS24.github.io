                <p align='justify'>NoCaSS, the Norwich-Cambridge Student Symposium for Plant and Microbial Sciences, is organised for students, by students. It brings together students from the Norwich Research Park and the University of Cambridge for a day of science and networking with the aim of establishing and strengthening connections between these two communities.</p>
<p align='justify'>It began in 2013, when students of Norwich and Cambridge realised they were sitting on an exciting opportunity. Being familiar with both institutions and recognising their proximity, not only geographically but also as leading institutes in the field of plant and microbial sciences, they realised that PhD students of both institutions weren't being given enough opportunities to interact.</p>
<p align='justify'>In the summer of the same year the first edition of NoCaSS was held at the John Innes Centre. The day was a great success, allowing students from the two cities to share and discuss their research, getting to know each other and building connections for future collaborations and friendships. Read about it <a target="_blank" href="https://johninnessvc.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/nocass-2014/">here</a> and watch the video below. </p>
<p align='justify'>In 2014, NoCaSS was hosted in Cambridge, continuing with its founding purpose, building on connections made the previous year, and also welcoming many new students. Read about it <a target="_blank" href="https://johninnessvc.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/nocass-2014-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p align='justify'>In 2015, NoCaSS was hosted in Norwich. 
<p align='justify'>After a year's hiatus, NoCaSS was back in Norwich 2017, for what was another great day!</p>
<p align='justify'>After another few years hiatus, NoCaSS is back again! </p>
<p align='justify'>Originally planned as an in person conference in summer 2020, we had to postpone it for a year due to covid. </p>
<p align='justify'>In June 2021 NoCaSS went virtual organised by students from Norwich. </p>
