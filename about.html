                <p align='justify'>NoCaSS, the Norwich-Cambridge Student Symposium for Plant and Microbial Sciences, is organised for students, by students. It brings together students from the Norwich Research Park and the University of Cambridge for a day of science and networking with the aim of establishing and strengthening connections between these two communities.</p>
<p align='justify'>It began in 2013, when students of Norwich and Cambridge realised they were sitting on an exciting opportunity. Being familiar with both institutions and recognising their proximity, not only geographically but also as leading institutes in the field of plant and microbial sciences, they realised that PhD students of both institutions weren't being given enough opportunities to interact.</p>
<p align='justify'>In the summer of the same year the first edition of NoCaSS was held at the John Innes Centre. The day was a great success, allowing students from the two cities to share and discuss their research, getting to know each other and building connections for future collaborations and friendships. Read about it <a target="_blank" href="https://johninnessvc.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/nocass-2014/">here</a> and watch the video below. </p>
<p align='justify'>In 2014, NoCaSS was hosted in Cambridge, continuing with its founding purpose, building on connections made the previous year, and also welcoming many new students. Read about it <a target="_blank" href="https://johninnessvc.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/nocass-2014-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p align='justify'>After a year's hiatus, NoCaSS is back in Norwich! Come and join us on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> August 2017 for what is sure to be another great day!</p>
<p align='justify'>After another few years hiatus, NoCaSS is back again! Come and join us in the summer of 2020 in Norwich to share you research and network across East Anglia.</p>
