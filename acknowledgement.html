              <p> Independent, not-for-profit and supported by funders, eLife improves the way research is practised and shared. We’re committed to creating a future where a diverse, global community of researchers shares open results for the benefit of all. We’ve introduced <a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research">a new publishing process</a> where we will no longer make accept/reject decisions at the end of the peer-review process; rather, all papers that have been peer reviewed will be published on our website as Reviewed Preprints, accompanied by an eLife assessment and public reviews.Learn more at <a target="_blank" href="elifesciences.org/about">elifesciences.org/about</a>. </p>
