              <p> Established in 1909, the John Innes Foundation’s mission is to advance the acquisition and application of knowledge about plants and microbes for societal, environmental and commercial benefit. It delivers this by supporting research, education, training and public engagement; and by encouraging agricultural innovation. Among much else, it is the primary sponsor of the prestigious JIF PhD Rotation programme at Norwich Research Park. </p>

              <p>KWS is one of the world’s leading plant breeding companies. Over 5,000 employees in more than 70 countries generated net sales of around €1.5 billion in the fiscal year 2021/2022. A company with a tradition of family ownership, KWS has operated independently for 165 years. It focuses on plant breeding and the production and sale of seed for corn, sugarbeet, cereals, vegetables, oilseed rape and sunflower. KWS uses leading-edge plant breeding methods to continuously improve yield for farmers and plants’ resistance to diseases, pests and abiotic stress. To that end, the company invested more than €285 million last fiscal year in research and development. </p>

              <p> Founded in 1819 by a group of Cambridge luminaries, Edward Clarke, John Stevens Henslow and Adam Sedgwick, the Cambridge Philosophical Society is in fact the oldest scientific society in Cambridge. It was created with the charitable aim of ‘of promoting scientific inquiry, and of facilitating the communication of facts connected with the advancement of Philosophy and Natural History’. The aims of the Society today are no different from its founders’, put simply, to promote research in all branches of science and to encourage the communication of the results of scientific research. </p>
              <p>The Society offers everyone:</p>
