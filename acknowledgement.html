              <p> Our mission: Shaping the culture of science by training scientists to be effective, inclusive, and authentic leaders. hfp consulting provides professional development workshops exclusively for the scientific community. We help researchers grow and succeed by working with them to develop leadership and management skills, by fostering personal development, as well as by strengthening interpersonal competencies and communication skills. Most of our experienced facilitators have a science background. They are active as postdoc, group leader, professor, or have moved into diverse other career paths. The style of our courses is process-oriented and interactive. Brief theoretical inputs are followed by exercises, partner work, role-plays, case studies and group-work. We have developed and established professional development workshops for scientists at leading organizations in Europe, the Middle East, USA, Africa and Japan. We have pioneered this new development in science and are honoured to continuously be working with clients like NBI, EMBL, MDC, BRIC, NNF centres, CRG, PRBB, Harvard Medical School, MIT, JHU, Cornell, Princeton, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Weizmann Institute of Science, to name only a few.

              <p> Founded in 1819 by a group of Cambridge luminaries, Edward Clarke, John Stevens Henslow and Adam Sedgwick, the Cambridge Philosophical Society is in fact the oldest scientific society in Cambridge. It was created with the charitable aim of ‘of promoting scientific inquiry, and of facilitating the communication of facts connected with the advancement of Philosophy and Natural History’. The aims of the Society today are no different from its founders’, put simply, to promote research in all branches of science and to encourage the communication of the results of scientific research. </p>
              <p>The Society offers everyone:</p>

              <p>KWS is one of the world’s leading plant breeding companies. Over 5,000 employees in more than 70 countries generated net sales of around €1.5 billion in the fiscal year 2021/2022. A company with a tradition of family ownership, KWS has operated independently for 165 years. It focuses on plant breeding and the production and sale of seed for corn, sugarbeet, cereals, vegetables, oilseed rape and sunflower. KWS uses leading-edge plant breeding methods to continuously improve yield for farmers and plants’ resistance to diseases, pests and abiotic stress. To that end, the company invested more than €285 million last fiscal year in research and development. </p>
